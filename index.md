# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ... Rickrolling!
Rickrolling is a memetic phenomenon where one "bamboozles" or tricks someone into falling to various mediums that lead to them listening to Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up"
Well, if you don't believe me, then [don't](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
